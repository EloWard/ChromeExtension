EloWard Twitch Chat Badges:

- Will be a badge icon following twitch badge icon rules and customs
- All users with the extension enabled will be able to see each others ranks
- The badge icon will be the rank emblem

Technical Implementation (Chrome Extension Approach):
1. Badge Integration via Browser Extension (like 7TV/BetterTTV):
   - Utilize our existing Chrome extension content script to modify Twitch chat
   - No need for Twitch Extension SDK - we inject badges directly into the DOM
   - No need for Twitch Extension manifest permissions - we use Chrome extension permissions
   - Backend service still needed to track user rank data and serve it to the extension

2. Badge Image Requirements:
   - Each rank emblem must be created in two sizes:
     - 18x18 pixels for standard chat view
     - 36x36 pixels for high-DPI/retina displays
   - Image format: PNG with transparency
   - File size: Max 10KB per badge image
   - Color profile: sRGB
   - Design consistency: Maintain a cohesive visual language across all rank emblems
   - Distinguishable at small sizes: Must be clearly identifiable even at 18x18px

3. Rank Emblem Design Considerations:
   - Create distinct visual progression between ranks
   - Follow Twitch's color palette guidelines to ensure badges look native
   - Consider accessibility - badges should be distinguishable even with color vision deficiency
   - For Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, etc. ranks, use appropriate color coding
   - Consider providing a subtle animation state for special ranks (optional)

4. Development Workflow (Chrome Extension specific):
   - Design all badge assets in a vector format first
   - Export to required PNG sizes with proper optimization
   - Place badge assets in the extension's images/ranks/ directory
   - Update content.js to handle badge injection logic
   - Test badge visibility in Twitch chat with extension enabled

5. Extension-to-Chat Integration (Chrome Extension approach):
   - Extension will use DOM manipulation to inject badges next to usernames
   - Extension will use MutationObserver to detect new chat messages (already implemented)
   - User rank data will be retrieved from our backend API
   - Consider WebSocket connection for real-time rank updates between users
   - Implement caching in localStorage or IndexedDB to minimize API calls

6. Advantages over Twitch Extension:
   - No need for Twitch review process
   - Full control over implementation
   - Similar to established extensions like 7TV and BetterTTV
   - Can be updated quickly without waiting for approval

7. Limitations compared to Twitch Extension:
   - Badges only visible to other users who have the extension installed
   - Requires browser extension installation rather than channel-based activation
   - Will need to be distributed through browser extension stores
   - May not have access to some Twitch APIs that official extensions would have
