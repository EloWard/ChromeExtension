EloWard Twitch Chat Badges:

- Will be a badge icon following twitch badge icon rules and customs
- All users with the extension enabled will be able to see each others ranks
- The badge icon will be the rank emblem

Technical Implementation:
1. Badge Integration with Twitch API:
   - Utilize Twitch Extension SDK to create custom chat badges
   - Implement a PubSub messaging system to communicate rank data between users
   - Badge display will require a Twitch Extension manifest update to request chat badge permissions
   - Backend service needs to track user rank data and serve it to the extension

2. Badge Image Requirements:
   - Each rank emblem must be created in two sizes:
     - 18x18 pixels for standard chat view
     - 36x36 pixels for high-DPI/retina displays
   - Image format: PNG with transparency
   - File size: Max 10KB per badge image
   - Color profile: sRGB
   - Design consistency: Maintain a cohesive visual language across all rank emblems
   - Distinguishable at small sizes: Must be clearly identifiable even at 18x18px

3. Rank Emblem Design Considerations:
   - Create distinct visual progression between ranks
   - Follow Twitch's color palette guidelines to ensure badges look native
   - Consider accessibility - badges should be distinguishable even with color vision deficiency
   - For Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, etc. ranks, use appropriate color coding
   - Consider providing a subtle animation state for special ranks (optional)

4. Development Workflow:
   - Design all badge assets in a vector format first
   - Export to required PNG sizes with proper optimization
   - Upload badges through Twitch Developer Console
   - Implement badge assignment logic in extension backend
   - Test badge visibility across different Twitch chat environments (web, mobile, app)

5. Extension-to-Chat Integration:
   - Extension will need to inject badge data into chat messages via Twitch Extension helper
   - Each user's rank data will be stored in a database and retrieved on extension load
   - Real-time rank updates will require a WebSocket connection for immediate badge updates
   - Consider caching strategies to minimize API calls for frequently seen chat participants
