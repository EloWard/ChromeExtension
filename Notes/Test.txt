How to test the extension:
1. Load the extension in Chrome using Developer mode
Click the EloWard icon to open the popup
3. Connect your accounts (simulated in the MVP)
Visit one of the active channels (riotgames, lcs, faker, doublelift, tyler1)
You should see rank badges appear next to usernames in chat
The extension is now ready for testing and can be further developed to implement the remaining stages, including the subscription system for streamers and other advanced features.
