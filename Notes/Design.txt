# EloWard: League of Legends Rank Badges for Twitch Chat

## Core Concept
EloWard is a Chrome extension that displays League of Legends rank badges next to usernames in Twitch chat, allowing viewers to showcase their in-game achievements while watching streams.

## Business Model
- **For Streamers**: A subscription-based service that streamers pay for to enable the feature in their chat
- **For Viewers**: Completely free to use, with badges only appearing in chats of subscribed streamers

## Key Features
1. **Rank Badge Display**: Automatically shows League of Legends rank badges (Iron through Challenger) next to usernames in Twitch chat
2. **Streamer-Activated**: Badges only appear in chats of streamers who have subscribed to the service
3. **Seamless Authentication**: Uses Riot RSO (Riot Sign On) for secure and user-friendly League account verification
4. **Account Linking**: Connects viewers' Twitch accounts with their League of Legends accounts
5. **Real-Time Rank Updates**: Badges reflect current League of Legends ranks, updated regularly

## Technical Requirements
- Integration with Riot Games API to fetch accurate rank data
- Twitch API integration for account linking and chat modification
- Secure authentication flow using Riot RSO
- Efficient caching system to respect Riot API rate limits
- Channel-specific activation based on streamer subscription status

## User Experience
- **For Streamers**: Simple subscription process with dashboard to manage their service
- **For Viewers**: One-time setup to link accounts, then badges appear automatically in supported channels
- **Badge Visibility**: Only visible to other users who have the extension installed

## Initial Scope
- League of Legends ranks only (potential to expand to other games later)
- Focus on core functionality before adding customization options
- Prioritize performance and minimal impact on Twitch experience
