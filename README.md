## Integration with Riot RSO Worker

This extension connects to a Cloudflare Worker that serves as a secure proxy for Riot RSO (Riot Sign On) authentication. The worker is currently deployed at:

```
https://eloward-riotrso.unleashai-inquiries.workers.dev
```

### Worker Endpoints

The Riot RSO Worker provides the following endpoints:

- `POST /auth/riot/init`: Initialize the authentication flow
- `POST /auth/riot/token`: Exchange authorization code for tokens
- `POST /auth/riot/token/refresh`: Refresh an expired token
- `GET /riot/account/me`: Proxy for Riot account API
- `GET /riot/summoner/me`: Proxy for Riot summoner API
- `GET /riot/league/entries`: Proxy for Riot league API

## How It Works

EloWard connects your Twitch username to your Riot ID, then uses the Riot Games API to fetch your current rank information. When you chat on Twitch, other users with the extension installed will see your rank badge next to your name.

When browsing Twitch channels with the extension active, you'll see rank badges next to other chatters who have connected their accounts.

## Privacy

EloWard only accesses:
- Your Twitch username (with your permission)
- Your Riot ID (with your permission)
- Your League of Legends rank data (public information)

We do not store any personal information beyond what's necessary for the extension to function. Your account connection data is stored locally on your device and is not shared with any third parties.
