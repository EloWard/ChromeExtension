Google Chrome Extension like 7tv.app:

EloWard:

- This app is a chrome extension that allows you to add badges next to your name in twitch chat.
- The badges will be your rank in a game.
- It will be a paid service that streamers can subscribe to, allowing their viewers to have a badge based on their rank in the game.
- The viewers will be able to use EloWard for free, but will only be activated in the chat of the subscribed streamers.
- Currently, it will only support League of Legends streamers and their viewers.
- Use the Riot API to get the data and Riot RSO to verify the user and have a clean experience logging into their riot account.
- If needed, can use the twitch api to link the twitch account to the league account.
